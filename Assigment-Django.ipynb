      " \n",
      "The skin, a formidable shield against intense heat and light, plays a pivotal role in regulating  \n",
      "body temperature while serving  as a storage reservoir  for fat and water. However, the  \n",
      "escalating incidence of skin cancer poses a formidable threat, particularly in countries like  \n",
      "Australia, the USA, and Canada. Beyond its protective functions, the skin's vulnerability to  \n",
      "damage, notably from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, raises concerns about  \n",
      "the onset  of skin cancer.  This condition  initiates  within  the skin cells,  the fundamental  building  \n",
      "blocks of this vital organ. The perpetual process of cell division and proliferation, essential  \n",
      "for skin growth, can sometimes lead to aberrations. Intriguingly, the meticulous orchestration  \n",
      "of cell turnover can misfire, resulting in the production of new skin cells when unnecessary,  \n",
      "coupled with the degeneration of aging skin cells. This imbalance manifests as tumors — \n",
      "peculiar lumps of tissue formed by the surplus of these rogue cells. Among the myriad forms  \n",
      "of skin cancer, melanoma stands out as the most prevalent and perilous variety. The insidious  \n",
      "nature of melanoma underscores the imperative for heightened awareness and preventive  \n",
      "measures in the ongoing battle against skin cancer. It also causes the highest rate of death.  \n",
      "Despite the fact that melanoma's precise cause is yet uncertain. UV radiation and paternal  \n",
      "genetics are two of the significant factors. In recent years, numerous studies have highlighted  \n",
      "the significant and rapidly growing adoption of computer vision techniques. This trend is  \n",
      "driven by the potential to reduce errors and accelerate diagnostic processes. Artificial neural  \n",
      "networks, inspired by the human brain and characterized by multiple layers of neurons, have  \n",
      "become  increasingly prevalent  in digital image  processing, computer vision, and  image  \n",

      "these  methods,  demonstrating  promising  outcomes  in challenging  tasks  such as object  \n",
      "detection.  For image  processing tasks,  pretrained  CNN  models  such as ResNet  and VGGNET  \n",
      "work just as well. In addition to model parameter tuning, hyperparameter tuning  is carried out  \n",
      "to increase  the model's  accuracy.  Own  dataset  has been  utilized.  Data  gathering,  \n",
      "preprocessing, data cleaning, visualization, and model creation are all steps in the research  \n",
